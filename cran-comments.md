## Resubmission Note
This is a package update, fixing a unit test which failed with dplyr version 1.0.0, which will be submitted to CRAN on May 1.

## Test Environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS on Travis, R 3.6.2

## R CMD CHECK results

No NOTEs, WARNINGs, or ERRORs.

## Downstream Dependencies
The package has one downstream dependency, the package PlackettLuce. This package is not affected by this change, as only a unit test has changed.
