#' Sample weights in the Bayesian Mallows model
#'
#' When more than one assessor have given the exact same rankings or preferences,
#' considerable speed-up can be obtained by providing only the unique set of
#' rankings/preferences to \code{\link{compute_mallows}}, and instead providing
#' the number of assessors in the \code{weights} argument. This topic is illustrated
#' here.
