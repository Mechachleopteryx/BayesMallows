# BayesMallows

This is the internal repository for development of the BayesMallows package. All feedback and suggestions are very welcome. Feel free to create a [Pull Request](https://github.uio.no/oyss/BayesMallows/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.uio.no/oyss/BayesMallows/issues).

Please also check out the [Suggested Roadmap](https://github.uio.no/oyss/BayesMallows/wiki/Roadmap).

## Coding Style

I follow [The tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). In particular, all `variable_names` with lowercase letters separated by underscore, function names are verbs, and object names are nouns.
